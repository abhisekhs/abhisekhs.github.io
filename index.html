         <h3> Research Interests</h3>
         <p>My research is in the areas of mathematical logic, particularly classical and finite model theory, and parameterized algorithms. My work is largely about adapting notions and results from classical (infinitary) model theory to the context of finite structures. Two of these of particular interest to me have been the Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem and the  Löwenheim-Skolem property. In parameterized algorithms, my interest is primarily in algorithmic metatheorems that provide a uniform means of obtaining fixed parameter tractable algorithms for all problems that can be defined in a given logic. Finally, I am also interested in structural (hyper)graph theory, particularly the notion of clique-width in the graph and geometric settings, in itself, and also for the various connections it has to logic and algorithms. <!--, in itself and for the various connections it has to logic and algorithms.-->

                         Seese's conjecture for finite graphs states that monadic second-order logic (MSO) is undecidable on all graph classes of unbounded clique-width.  We show that to establish this it would suffice to show that grids of unbounded size can be interpreted in two families of graph classes: minimal hereditary classes of unbounded clique-width; and antichains of unbounded clique-width under the induced subgraph relation.  We explore all the currently known classes of the former category and establish that grids of unbounded size can indeed be interpreted in them.

                     The Feferman-Vaught theorem provides a way of evaluating a first order sentence φ on a disjoint union of structures by producing a decomposition of φ into sentences which can be evaluated on the individual structures and the results of these evaluations combined using a propositional formula. This decomposition can in general be non-elementarily larger than φ. We show that for FO sentences in prenex normal form with a fixed number of quantifier alternations, such a decomposition can be obtained in time elementary in the size of φ.

                        It is well known that the classic Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem fails in the finite: there are first-order definable classes of finite structures closed under extensions which are not definable (in the finite) in the existential fragment of first-order logic. We strengthen this by constructing for every n, first-order definable classes of finite structures closed under extensions which are not definable with n quantifier alternations. The classes we construct are definable in the extension of Datalog with negation and indeed in the existential fragment of transitive-closure logic. This answers negatively an open question posed by Rosen and Weinstein.

                         We consider classes of arbitrary (finite or infinite) graphs of bounded shrub-depth, specifically the class TM<sub>r,p</sub>(d) of p-labeled arbitrary graphs whose underlying unlabeled graphs have tree models of height d and r labels. We show that this class satisfies an extension of the classical Löwenheim-Skolem property into the finite and for MSO. This extension being a generalization of the small model property, we obtain that the graphs of TM<sub>r,p</sub>(d) are pseudo-finite. In addition, we obtain as consequences entirely new proofs of a number of known results concerning bounded shrub-depth classes (of finite graphs) and TM<sub>r,p</sub>(d). These include the small model property for MSO with elementary bounds, the classical compactness theorem from model theory over TM<sub>r,p</sub>(d), and the equivalence of MSO and FO over TM<sub>r,p</sub>(d) and hence over bounded shrub-depth classes. The proof for the last of these is via an adaptation of the proof of the classical Lindström's theorem characterizing FO over arbitrary structures.

                     We prove that the exact crossing number of a graph can be efficiently computed for simple graphs having bounded vertex cover. In more precise words, Crossing Number is in FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover size. This is a notable advance since we know only very few nontrivial examples of graph classes with unbounded and yet efficiently computable crossing number. Our result can be viewed as a strengthening of a previous result of Lokshtanov [arXiv, 2015] that Optimal Linear Arrangement is in FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover size, and we use a similar approach of reducing the problem to a tractable instance of Integer Quadratic Programming as in Lokshtanov’s paper.

                     We present a new proof of the generalized Łoś-Tarski theorem (GLT(k)) from [6], over arbitrary structures. Instead of using λ-saturation as in [6], we construct just the "required saturation" directly using ascending chains of structures. We also strengthen the failure of GLT(k) in the finite shown in [7], by strengthening the failure of the Łoś-Tarski theorem in this context. In particular, we prove that not just universal sentences, but for each fixed k, even Σ^0_2 sentences containing k existential quantifiers fail to capture hereditariness in the finite. We conclude with two problems as future directions, concerning the Łoś-Tarski theorem and GLT(k), both in the context of all finite structures.

                         We present a model-theoretic property of finite structures, that can be seen to be a finitary analogue of the well-studied downward Löwenheim-Skolem property from classical model theory. We call this property the *L-equivalent bounded substructure property*, denoted L-EBSP, where L is either FO or MSO. Intuitively, L-EBSP states that a large finite structure contains a small "logically similar" substructure, where logical similarity means indistinguishability with respect to sentences of L having a given quantifier nesting depth. It turns out that this simply stated property is enjoyed by a variety of classes of interest in computer science: examples include regular languages of words, trees (unordered, ordered or ranked) and nested words, and various classes of graphs, such as cographs, graph classes of bounded tree-depth, those of bounded shrub-depth and n-partite cographs. Further, L-EBSP remains preserved in the classes generated from the above by operations that are implementable using quantifier-free translation schemes. All of the aforementioned classes admit natural tree representations for their structures. We use this fact to show that the small and logically similar substructure of a large structure in any of these classes, can be computed in time linear in the size of the tree representation of the structure, giving linear time fixed parameter tractable (f.p.t.) algorithms for checking L-definable properties of the large structure. We conclude by presenting a strengthening of L-EBSP, that asserts "logical self-similarity at all scales" for a suitable notion of scale. We call this the *logical fractal* property and show that most of the classes mentioned above are indeed, logical fractals.

                      We present new parameterized preservation properties that provide for each natural number k, semantic characterizations of the ∃<sup>k</sup>∀<sup>⁎</sup> and ∀<sup>k</sup>∃<sup>⁎</sup> prefix classes of first order logic sentences, over the class of all structures and for arbitrary finite vocabularies. These properties, that we call preservation under substructures modulo k-cruxes and preservation under k-ary covered extensions respectively, correspond exactly to the classical properties of preservation under substructures and preservation under extensions, when k equals 0. As a consequence, we get a parameterized generalization of the Łoś–Tarski preservation theorem for sentences, in both its substructural and extensional forms. We call our characterizations collectively the generalized Łoś–Tarski theorem for sentences. We generalize this theorem to theories, by showing that theories that are preserved under k-ary covered extensions are characterized by theories of ∀<sup>k</sup>∃<sup>⁎</sup> sentences, and theories that are preserved under substructures modulo k-cruxes, are equivalent, under a well-motivated model-theoretic hypothesis, to theories of ∃<sup>k</sup>∀<sup>⁎</sup> sentences. In contrast to existing preservation properties in the literature that characterize the Σ<sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub> and Π<sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub> prefix classes of FO sentences, our preservation properties are combinatorial and finitary in nature, and stay non-trivial over finite structures as well.

                     We present a logic-based combinatorial property of classes of finite structures that allows an effective generalization of the Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem to hold over classes satisfying the property. The well-studied classes of words and trees, and structures of bounded tree-depth are shown to satisfy the property. We also show that starting with classes satisfying this property, the classes generated by applying composition operations like disjoint union, cartesian and tensor products, inherit the property. We finally show that all classes of structures that are well-quasi-ordered under the embedding relation satisfy a natural generalization of our property.

                     We investigate a model-theoretic property that generalizes the classical notion of preservation under substructures. We call this property preservation under substructures modulo bounded cores, and present a syntactic characterization via Σ^0_2 sentences for properties of arbitrary structures definable by FO sentences. Towards a sharper characterization, we conjecture that the count of existential quantifiers in the Σ^0_2 sentence equals the size of the smallest bounded core. We show that this conjecture holds for special fragments of FO and also over special classes of structures. We present a (not FO-definable) class of finite structures for which the conjecture fails, but for which the classical Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem holds. As a fallout of our studies, we obtain combinatorial proofs of the Łoś-Tarski theorem for some of the aforementioned cases.

Vis-`a-vis the characterizations of the aforesaid theories provided by H. J.

                        It is well known that the classic Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem fails in the finite: there are first-order definable classes of finite structures closed under extensions which are not definable (in the finite) in the existential fragment of first-order logic. We strengthen this by constructing for every n, first-order definable classes of finite structures closed under extensions which are not definable with n quantifier alternations. The classes we construct are definable in the extension of Datalog with negation and indeed in the existential fragment of transitive-closure logic. This answers negatively an open question posed by Rosen and Weinstein.

                        The Los-Tarski theorem is a result from classical model theory that states that over arbitrary (finite or infinite) structures, a first order (FO) sentence is hereditary if, and only if, it is equivalent to a universal sentence. This theorem however fails when restricted to finite structures. Tait (1959) and independently Gurevich and Shelah (1984) showed that in the finite (i.e. over the class of all finite structures), there is an FO sentence that is hereditary but that is not equivalent to any universal sentence.<br><br>
                        In a recent paper [2], a strengthening of the above failure was shown: in the finite, for every k, there is a hereditary FO sentence that is not equivalent to any \Sigma^0_2 sentence that contains k existential quantifiers. We generalize this result by showing in the finite, that for every n, there is a hereditary FO sentence \varphi_n that is not equivalent to any \Sigma^0_n sentence. In short, (FO-)hereditariness over all finite structures is not capturable by any prefix class of FO. We show further that \neg \varphi_n is expressible in Datalog(\neq, \neg), thus answering in the negative an open question posed by Rosen and Weinstein [1], that asks whether FO \cap Datalog(\neq, \neg) is contained (semantically) inside some prefix class of FO. The methods used to show our result extend the ideas from [2] in a significant way, and involve the construction of structures that exhibit self-similarity.<br>

                        We present a (partial) survey of the area of algorithmic metatheorems. These theorems provide fixed parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for the model checking problem, namely the problem of checking if an input structure from a given class of structures satisfies a property that is expressible in a given logic, like say first order logic (FO) or monadic second order logic (MSO). The parameters in these algorithms are the size of the logical description of the property, along with (the numerical description of) some structural aspect of the input structure. We look at various well-studied classes of posets and graphs that admit such FPT algorithms and give the intuitive ideas behind the techniques involved.

                        We present a model-theoretic approach for the problem of FO/MSO model checking over a given class of graphs. Specifically, we consider classes that are represented using trees in which the leaf nodes are labeled with simple structures (typically, point graphs) and the internal nodes are labeled with operations on structures. We show that if the operations satisfy the Feferman-Vaught composition property, then the model checking problem admits kernelization and linear time f.p.t. algorithms.  This result provides a unified approach for handling a variety of sparse and dense graph classes: graphs of bounded tree-width, bounded tree-depth, bounded shrub-depth,bounded clique-width/rank-width and m-partite cographs, and graphs obtained from these using various well-studied operations such as complementation, line-graph, disjoint union, series-parallel connects and the Cartesian and tensor products.
